# Function-verification
A Solidity Function to Calculate Balance:
A Solidity function where users can deposit money, and their balances are updated after each deposit.

Properties of the Function:
The function must ensure:
The balance only increases after a deposit.
The deposit amount must be greater than zero.
The function must correctly calculate and return the updated balance.

How the Code Meets the Properties
Balance Only Increases:
The balance is updated by adding the deposit amount: balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender] + amount;.
This ensures the balance never decreases.

Valid Deposit Amount:
The require statement ensures that deposits less than or equal to zero are rejected.
Correct Balance Update:

The new balance is calculated by correctly adding the deposit to the old balance, and this is returned to the user.

How Formal Verification Could Help Prove the Correctness of a Deposit Function
The function's correctness is critical in blockchain applications where even minor errors can lead to financial loss or exploitation. Formal verification is a method that can mathematically prove the function behaves as intended under all possible conditions.

Role of Formal Verification
Formal verification helps ensure that the deposit function adheres to specific correctness properties by proving these properties mathematically

1. Defining Key Properties
To prove the correctness of the deposit function, we define key properties that the function must satisfy:

Balance Non-Decreasing: After a deposit, the user's balance should either increase or remain unchanged (it should never decrease).
Correct Balance Update: The new balance must equal the previous balance plus the deposit amount.
Valid Deposit: The function should accept only positive deposit amounts.
Prevention of Overflows: The function should prevent balance overflows, ensuring the balance does not exceed the maximum limit of the data type.
